# MegaText
A personal project I call megatext - It is a very small python program in which
you record details of your life each month. 

By the end you will have a "mega" text file of all the things that were
happening in your life. I chose this as my best software project as I had a
*need* and I was able to provide a simple software *solution* - store files
disk and let me use any editor I want. I enjoyed using the program and
refactoring and adding features as I felt needed.
